# Policy: Public Holiday

## Requirements
- Stop running resources in dev environment off-hours.
- Stop running resources in dev environment on weekends.
- Not to start stopped resources in dev environment during public holidays.
- Start resources in dev environment in work hours.

## Example Policy
Note: As AWS RDS for example, you can apply the policy to other resources as well.
```yaml
policies:
  - name: StopDuringOffHours
    resource: aws.rds
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: DBInstanceStatus
        op: eq
        value: available
      - type: offhour
#        opt-out: false (default) # resources must have the tag (key) in order to be acted on by the policy
#        opt-out: true # resources without the tag are acted on by the policy.
        default_tz: "Australia/Sydney"
        offhour: 18
    actions:
      - stop
      - type: tag
        tags: 
          stopped_by_cloud_custodian_at: '{now}'
  - name: Restore
    resource: aws.rds
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: DBInstanceStatus
        op: eq
        value: stopped
      - type: onhour
        default_tz: "Australia/Sydney"
        onhour: 9
        skip-days: ['2024-10-23']
        weekends: true
    actions:
      - start
      - type: tag
        tags: 
          stopped_by_cloud_custodian_at: '{now}'
```
1. The policy `StopDuringOffHours` stops RDS instances during off-hours. The off-hours are defined as 6 PM in Sydney timezone. 
2. The policy `Restore` starts stopped RDS instances during work hours. The work hours are defined as 9 AM in Sydney timezone. 
3. The policy skips starting instances on 23rd October 2024. 
4. The policy does not start instances on weekends as setup weekends equals true(the default value is true).

## skip-days-from

```yaml
policies:
  - name: RestoreFromCSV
    resource: aws.rds
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: DBInstanceStatus
        op: eq
        value: stopped
      - type: onhour
        default_tz: "Australia/Sydney"
        onhour: 9
        skip-days-from:
          url: s3://{bucket}/holidays.csv
          format: csv
          expr: 0
    actions:
      - start
      - type: tag
        tags: 
          stopped_by_cloud_custodian_at: '{now}'
```
Policy `RestoreFromCSV` starts stopped RDS instances during work hours. The work hours are defined as 9 AM in Sydney timezone. 
The policy skips starting instances on the days defined in the CSV file stored in the S3 bucket.

p.s.
- The CSV file should have the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
    ```
    2024-10-23
    2024-10-24
    ...
    ```
- If you run the policy locally, please be careful with cache. You may need to clear the cache to get the latest CSV file.
    ```shell
    rm ~/.cache/cloud-custodian.cache
    ```

pros:
- The policy is flexible. You can define the public holidays in the CSV file.
- You can use `weekends`, `weekends-only` to skip weekends or select weekends only.
- You can use either `skip-days` or `skip-days-from` to skip specific days.
- You can use `opt-out` to define whether resources must have the tag in order to be acted on by the policy.

cons:
- Considering the date of public holiday maybe different in each year, you need to update the CSV file every year.

## opt-out
```yaml
policies:
  - name: StopDuringOffHours
    resource: aws.rds
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: DBInstanceStatus
        op: eq
        value: available
      - type: offhour
        tag: custodian-downtime # default: maid_offhours
        default_tz: "Australia/Sydney"
        opt-out: true
        offhour: 13
    actions:
      - start
      - type: tag
        tags: 
          stopped_by_cloud_custodian_at: '{now}'
```

1. The policy `StopDuringOffHours` stops RDS instances during off-hours. The off-hours are defined as 1 PM in Sydney timezone. 
2. The policy does not act on resources with the tag `custodian-downtime` and value is `off`. 
3. The policy will act on resources with the tag `custodian-downtime` and value is empty or the non-empty value other than `off`.

p.s. You can use `opt-out` for `onhour` poilcy as well.
