# System Health Rating

## WHY
We keep experiencing the improvements teams make to their ecosystem by treating the health rating the same as other service-level objectives (SLOs) and prioritizing enhancements accordingly, instead of solely focusing on tracking technical debt. By allocating resources efficiently to address the most impactful issues related to health, teams and organizations can reduce long-term maintenance costs and evolve products more efficiently. This approach also enhances communication between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, fostering a common understanding of the system's state. Although metrics may vary among organizations they ultimately contribute to long-term sustainability and ensure software remains adaptable and competitive. In a rapidly changing digital landscape, focusing on tracking health over debt of systems provides a structured and evidence-based strategy to maintain and enhance them.
## WHAT
Base one the REA group's research and experience, we will track system ratings in the categories of development, operations and architecture.
## WHEN
1. When creating a new system, we should strive to ensure it remains healthy.
2. Regularly check the system health rating to ensure the system remains healthy.   
## HOW
Follow the guidelines in the [system-health-rating](https://github.com/claywares/system-health-rating?tab=readme-ov-file#the-mechanics) to rate the system.
