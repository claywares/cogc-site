Not sure about what an IPR is, and which decision-making framework is appropriate when?

This template is compatible with the Decider, Accountable, Responsible, Consulted, Informed (DARCI)  model and is provided to assist you when documenting an IPR.

**PRE IPR Checklist** - Please make sure these tasks have been completed before hosting the IPR session:

- [ ] Add a Group label (e.g. `2: WeChat`) that represents the group that is driving this IPR. There should only be one Group label added.
- [ ] Remove the `1: Draft` status label when you're ready for people to read your IPR.
- [ ] Update session Date, Location & Zoom ID and message Slack channel.
- [ ] PRE IPR sessions have been organised to give relevant context to all interested parties.
- [ ] Decision maker has been agreed upon and documented.

**POST IPR** - Please make sure these tasks have been completed after the decision has been made:

- [ ] Outcome has been documented in the summary section outlining which decision was chosen and why.
- [ ] IPR Issue has been closed.
- [ ] Add the `1: Endorsed`, `1: Abandoned` or `2: On Hold` label to indicate if an outcome has been reached.
- [ ] Add the `3: Tactical` or `3: Strategic` label to indicate if the outcome is in line with your group's tech strategy.

## <a href="#user-content-summary" id="summary">Summary</a>

<!--
Provide a few paragraphs summarising the IPR including a summary of the context, problem, and constraints. This should allow someone familiar with the space to understand what the decision is about.
-->

### <a href="#user-content-outcome" id="outcome">Outcome</a>

<!--
Once the IPR has concluded update this summary to include the outcome. Including any acknowledged consequences and/or risk mitigation steps including an assessment of impact on system health.

This section should be brief – no more than 3-4 paragraphs (150 – 300 words).

Cost [$|$$|$$$|$$$$] - ??

<!--
this isn't a comprehensive cost analysis. It's best effort for teams. In case the solution looks like $$$ or $$$$, make sure you reach out to our AWS Technical Account Manager - TAM (he/she is in Slack) and ask for a more detailed quote.

#### <a href="#user-content-decision-maker" id="decision-maker">Interested Parties</a>

<!--
There are many interested parties, from the decision maker themselves to (potentially) many people.

DARCI framework:

The **Decider** (or Decision Maker) is one or multiple individuals who will decide the IPR outcome. This CANNOT be a team.
The Decision Maker might not be the IPR author but is one of the Interested Parties and will be present at the final meeting.
The Decision Maker is responsible for ensuring that the Interested Parties table is filled out and exercised.

The **Accountable** entry MUST be a single individual, typically the same individual who is the **Decider**. 
This is the single person accountable for following through on this IPR.

The **Responsible** entry can be individuals and/or teams.
These people are responsbile for following through on this IPR.

The **Consulted** entry can be individuals and/or teams.
These people are consulted to ensure the proper supporting data exists.

The **Informed** entry can be individuals and/or teams.
Who needs to hear about this decision as it progresses and once it's made? People listed here are optional in the room.

Consider:
  - Guilds
  - People in other LOBs that do similar things

Use `<br>` to separate the names.

## <a href="#user-content-context" id="context">Context</a>

<!--
Describe why you are solving the problem and what the problem is.

This is usually where you talk about the particular project and value being added as well as describe any current systems that are relevant. Defining goals in measurable terms will greatly aid future review of the IPR outcome.

As you consult various interested parties include any insights gained. It might benefit those reading to note when the conversation occurred, who was present, and what was discussed. If any options are no starters, then briefly describe these (rather than cluttering the options section with non-genuine options).

Provide references to any related documents.

## <a href="#user-content-constraints-assumptions-risks" id="constraints-assumptions-risks">Constraints, Assumptions, Risks</a>

<!--
Describe any constraints, assumptions, or risks influencing the decision. Consider impacts of risks in both a technical (Access, Availability, Agility, Accuracy) and operational (Financial, People, Suppliers/External) context. Use a single list of separate subsections as you see fit. These could include things like:

- A competitor has shipped a similar product and time to market is key to avoid consumer migration and lock in;
- The team has no experience with technology xyz before;
- A data migration must occur without any operational systems experiencing downtime;
- Highly sensitive data is being transmitted therefore security oversight is critical.

During the review be prepared to challenge the constraints and/or consider risk mitigation approaches through the options.

## <a href="#user-content-options" id="options">Plan / Options</a>

Preferred option(s): <!-- Indicate the preferred option or options, if applicable. This is not to pre-suppose the outcome of the IPR. Rather, this should indicate to readers of this issue the preferred/anticipated/expected options. -->

<!--
Outline a number of available options and provide an assessment of the relevant trade-offs.

This is traditionally provided as a list of pros and cons but can take any format that works. Please ensure option consideration includes identification of risk. It is important to be clear on the level of risk individuals can accept on behalf the company.

Note that you might be conducting an IPR to endorse a particular plan or approach - i.e. validating one path forward rather than choosing between options. In this case you would outline research that has led to this point.  The constraints etc section would also support that choice.
