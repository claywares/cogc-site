# Cost Saving

## WHY
1. Control Over Operating Expenses
   * Cloud's Pay-As-You-Go Model: While beneficial, it can lead to runaway costs if resources aren’t carefully managed.
   * Organizations save money by right-sizing instances, avoiding overprovisioning, and reducing underutilized resources.
2. Improved Return on Investment (ROI)
   * Optimizing costs ensures businesses maximize the value gained from the money spent on cloud services.
   * Excessive expenses on unnecessary resources can dilute the financial benefits of cloud migration.
3. Preventing Cost Overruns
   * Without monitoring, autoscaling and dynamic provisioning can lead to unexpected bills.
   * Regular cost reviews help avoid financial surprises and maintain predictable expenditures.
4. Business Agility
   * Cost-saving strategies such as automation, workload scheduling, and efficient resource allocation improve operational efficiency.
   * Enables quicker adaptation to business demands without overcommitting resources.

## WHAT
Cost saving refers to the strategic management and optimization of cloud computing expenses to reduce unnecessary spending while maintaining performance, reliability, and scalability. It involves adopting practices, tools, and strategies to ensure that the organization pays only for the resources it needs and uses efficiently.

## WHEN 
1. During Regular Financial Reviews: Routine audits help identify trends and prevent overspending.
2. When Identifying Cost Spikes: Unexpected increases in cloud bills can signal inefficiencies or mismanagement.
3. Periodically as Part of Optimization Efforts: Continuous improvement ensures that new inefficiencies don’t creep in as workloads evolve.
4. After Initial Cloud Deployment: New cloud setups often have overprovisioned resources to ensure smooth operations, which can lead to unnecessary costs.
5. When Adopting New Technologies: Migrating to new services (e.g., serverless or managed services) can offer better cost efficiency.

## HOW
1. Right-Sizing Resources
   * Adjusting resource allocations (e.g., computing power, storage, and memory) to match actual workload requirements
   * Avoids overprovisioning or underutilization.
2. Auto-Scaling and Scheduling
   * Scaling resources up or down based on demand.
   * Shutting down non-essential resources during non-peak hours.
3. Using Reserved or Spot Instances
   * Committing to long-term usage (reserved instances) for predictable workloads to save costs.
   * Using spot instances or preemptible VMs for non-critical or flexible workloads at a fraction of the cost.
4. Monitoring and Analytics
   * Implementing cost management tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) to track and analyze spending.
   * Detecting unused or underused resources.
5. Implementing Governance Policies
   * Establishing spending limits, enforcing tagging of resources for better visibility, and conducting regular audits.
6. Choosing the Right Pricing Models
   * Selecting pay-as-you-go for flexible needs or flat-rate models for predictable usage patterns.
7. Leveraging Discounts and Savings Plans
   * Taking advantage of volume discounts, free-tier offers, and loyalty programs offered by cloud providers.
8. Migrating to Cost-Efficient Services
   * Transitioning to managed services, open-source alternatives, or serverless architectures to reduce operational costs.
