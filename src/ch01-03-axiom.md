# Axiom

## WHY
Axioms, in the context of a company, serve as foundational principles that guide decision-making at a strategic level. They provide a framework for evaluating options, ensuring consistency, and preventing unnecessary complexity.

Key Benefits:

- Consistency: Axioms establish a common ground for decision-making, reducing inconsistencies and ensuring alignment across teams.
- Efficiency: By providing a clear framework, axioms can streamline decision-making processes and reduce wasted time.
- Scalability: Axioms can help organizations scale effectively by providing a consistent approach to decision-making, even as the company grows.
- Innovation: Axioms can foster innovation by encouraging critical thinking and challenging the status quo.

## WHAT
Axioms are used to make big decisions in a company that affect many teams and/or have significant consequences.

Axioms are fundamental truths or assumptions that are accepted without proof. In a corporate context, they are principles that guide decision-making at a strategic level. They can be used to establish guidelines for technology choices, organizational structure, or business strategy.

## WHEN
Axioms are particularly useful for making decisions that:

- Have a significant impact on the company's direction or strategy.
- Involve multiple teams or departments.
- Require a long-term perspective.
- Involve complex trade-offs or competing priorities.

## HOW
**Everyone can submit ideas.**  The Axioms intent is to bring alignment across the company, but we also want accelerated aligned autonomy in the leanest possible ways.
- Decision-Makers: Architects and Tech Leads that may run IPRs to support an experiment within an axiom will be a "D" on their own team specific IPRs.
- Consulted: All consulting parties will be "C" of the axiom.
- Informed: Interested teams may choose to be subscribed to some of the decisions.
