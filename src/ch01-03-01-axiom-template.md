<!--
This template is compatible with the Decision Maker, Consulted and Informed (DCI) model and is provided to assist you when documenting an Axiom. It provides standard sections we imagine are relevant to all Axioms, references to supporting assets to help with discovery, and pointers to help you along the way. Weâ€™d appreciate you trying it out and iterating on the format as the use of a templated layout will make data discovery easier to automate.

Axioms require conversation and proper understanding of the options. The aim is to get it done properly, so allow time for it to happen 1-4 weeks is the rule of thumb.  Where significant experiments are being undertaken, Axioms can expect to take longer.

Don't expect people to rock up to the showcase and make a decision/recommendation. The decision itself should be done, collaboratively, during the entire process and properly described in the "Experiments" section.

## **Summary Information**

Item | Detail
-- | --
Summary: | Description.
Showcase Date(s) & Location(s): | Description
Decision Maker: | Description
Consulted: | Description
Informed: | Description

<!--
Summarise:
* TL;DR for the need for a decision/recommendation with context, problem, and constraints
* the domain covered
* how is this a Type 1 (hard to revert) company-wide decision
  
Decision Maker:
The DCI model requires us to nominate an individual to make a decision and, for Axioms, that individual must be a member of the Architecture group.
 
Consulted:
People that:
* are impacted short, medium and long terms
* are experts and will actively contribute to guide the decision
 
To find out the teams use the Slack channel to communicate for socialisation.

Informed:
* Because Axioms effect whole company, think of this as the comms plan:
** Showcases gather the people to announce the decision/recommendation
** Blogposts
** Slack channels
** Reference implementations such as stencils or blueprints
** Git repo with examples

Consider sending to:
* Guilds - check the list for leaders and sponsors
* LOBs
* Procurement (if licences or contracting is needed)
-->


## **Context**
<!-- 
Describe why you are solving the problem and what the problem is.

This is usually where you articulate the need for a change and value being added as well as describe any current systems that are relevant. Defining goals in measurable terms will greatly aid the discussion and options assessment.

Provide references to any related documents.
-->

## Constraints, Assumptions, Risks
<!-- 
Describe any constraints, assumptions, or risks influencing the decision. Consider impacts of risks in both a technical (Access, Availability, Agility, Accuracy) and operational (Financial, People, Suppliers/External) context. 

During the experiments consider risk mitigation approaches.

## Implementations / Experiments
<!--
Experiments are list of POCs, spikes, Git Issues that show how we tried to use the options. The outcome of the Axiom determines which of the experiments shall be further validated.

Implementations are list of different permutations or ways of actually adhering to the Axiom. These would drive different patterns and standard for aligning with the Axiom.

In many cases, Experiments alone would suffice and future IPR's confirmation implementations. However, there may well be cases where Implementations are required to illustrate different patterns or approaches to align with the Axiom.
-->


## Outcome
<!--
Decision/Recommendation: 

Include any acknowledge consequences and/or risk mitigation steps as per Axiom process flow and like IPRs, this should include an assessment of impact on system health.

Communicate the closure and outcome via Slack channel and respective posts.
