# Interested Parties Review

## WHY
- In any large organization, decisions are made at various levels and often with complex interdependencies. The IPR exists to address the need for structured decision-making where multiple variables, such as technology, market demands, and team dynamics, converge.
- By providing a formal process, IPR helps mitigate the risk of making isolated decisions that may have unforeseen negative consequences in other areas. For example, a tech decision that aligns with the product strategy but ignores operational constraints could cause delays or inefficiencies.
- The process promotes accountability. Since documentation is required, there's less risk of losing key decision rationale when teams evolve, personnel change, or project scope shifts.
- IPR also fosters collaboration and inclusivity, allowing stakeholders across different departments to align, which ultimately contributes to a more cohesive and robust decision-making culture.

## WHAT
Interested Parties Reviews (IPRs) are used to make design decisions across teams, tribes, and groups.
- The IPR process is designed to bring **structured rigor** to decision-making, focusing on the participation of all relevant stakeholders. This is especially critical in complex systems where one decision can affect multiple areas (e.g., development, operations, and architecture).
- It involves multiple phases:
  - Preparation – Teams compile relevant data, anticipate challenges, and determine the scope of the decision.
  - Stakeholder Involvement – Interested parties are invited to provide input, which includes representatives from various domains to ensure all perspectives are considered.
  - Discussion and Decision – The team collaboratively reviews all inputs and perspectives before making the final decision. A consensus is typically the goal but may not always be necessary, as leadership may make a final call based on input.
- The documentation aspect is critical, as it captures not just the final decision but the reasoning, alternative options considered, and the impacts. This ensures transparency and serves as a future reference point, especially in a fast-moving organization where past decisions may need revisiting.

## WHEN
- The IPR process should be invoked whenever significant design, strategic, or technical decisions need to be made—especially those that involve cross-functional dependencies.
- It is particularly helpful in:
  - Major architectural decisions: when choosing platforms, tools, or methodologies that could affect the company's future scalability.
  - Cross-functional projects: where teams from different areas (e.g., product, engineering, operations) need alignment.
  - Strategic pivots or transformations: when decisions need to be made that could impact long-term strategy or organizational change (e.g., adopting new technology or entering a new market).
- The process is flexible enough to apply to different stages of decision-making, from early scoping to more detailed evaluations. However, timing is crucial: early engagement helps avoid costly late-stage changes, while late-stage reviews ensure that all risks and dependencies are considered before finalizing.

## HOW
- The process starts by identifying the decision to be made and determining the key stakeholders who should be involved. The key here is ensuring all relevant domains (technical, business, legal, etc.) are represented, reducing the risk of siloed decision-making.
- Teams then gather information relevant to all the options. This may include technical evaluations, market data, customer insights, or operational metrics. The quality of this information will directly impact the effectiveness of the decision-making process.
- An IPR meeting is held where the decision is formally reviewed. Discussions should focus on:
  - The potential impact of each option on different areas (development, operations, architecture).
  - Risks and mitigation strategies.
  - Alternative solutions and why they were not proposed.
- Documentation plays a critical role at this stage. A detailed record should include:
  - The options themselves.
  - The rationale behind them.
  - The stakeholders involved.
  - Any potential risks and how they will be mitigated.
- Support tools: To streamline the process, we have introduced template to reduce the administrative overhead, making it easier for teams to document and organize information. This template also make the IPR process more accessible to newer or less experienced teams.

Supplementary Notes:
- IPR as a Learning Process: One aspect that might not be immediately apparent is the learning culture IPR fosters. As teams reflect on past decisions, both successes and failures, they gather insights that inform future decisions. This feedback loop not only improves the IPR process but also helps the organization build a shared understanding of how decisions impact long-term outcomes.
- Balance between Rigor and Flexibility: While IPR is designed to ensure comprehensive decision-making, it's important that the process does not become overly rigid. Teams should balance rigor with agility—making sure the framework adapts to the urgency and scale of the decision at hand. For instance, not all decisions require the same level of formal review, and overburdening teams with process could be counterproductive.
- Cultural Impact: Over time, as IPR becomes embedded in your organization's culture, it may serve to align the company's values (such as transparency, accountability, and collaboration). By consistently involving multiple stakeholders and ensuring documentation, IPR helps create a culture where decisions are made in a democratic, informed manner.
