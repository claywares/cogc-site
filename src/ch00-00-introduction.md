# Introduction

## Chances of Greater Consistency

This document introduces the concept of a "COGC", or "chances for greater consistency".

An COGC is a document that **names** and **describes** a pattern or practice that may be broadly applicable (across a tech company).

## Background
In a tech company, **team autonomy** is a core value. However, when teams are primarily focused on achieving their individual goals, it can be challenging to find moments for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

By clearly naming concepts and providing concise, coherent definitions, we aim to make it easier to discuss and evaluate their value, thereby fostering alignment and consistency across teams.

## Definition
### Structure
- **Title**: The name of pattern, e.g. `Auto Scripts`
- **WHY**: Problem statement, background clarification.
- **WHAT**: The definition of this COGC pattern.
- **WHEN**: Explain when should team use this COGC pattern.
- **HOW**: Explain the implementation detail of this COGC pattern.

### Terminology

- **COGC document**: This is a document to describe the problem that the pattern can resolve and what's the pattern means. And how to implement the pattern.
- **COGC pattern**: This can be a recurring solution to solve a common problem in team autonomy area specifically.
- **Some keywords**: The keywords "must", "must not", "should", "should not", and "may" in an OFC document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
