# The 12-factor App

## WHY
The 12-factor app methodology was developed to address the challenges faced by developers building modern, cloud-native applications. It provides a set of principles and best practices that help create applications that are:

- Portable: Can be easily deployed on any cloud platform or even on-premises.
- Scalable: Can handle increasing workloads without significant changes.
- Maintainable: Easy to update, troubleshoot, and manage.
- Resilient: Tolerant of failures and disruptions.

## WHAT
The 12-factor app methodology consists of 12 principles that guide application development:

- Codebase: One codebase tracked in a version control system.
- Dependencies: Declare and isolate dependencies.
- Configuration: Treat configuration as code.
- Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources.
- Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and release stages from run.
- Processes: Execute the application as one or more processes.
- Port binding: Bind application to a port.
- Concurrency: Scale horizontally by adding more processes.
- Disposability: Processes should be disposable.
- Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
- Logs: Treat logs as event streams.
- Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

## WHEN
The 12-factor app methodology is particularly applicable to cloud-native applications, but it can also be beneficial for traditional applications that need to be more portable, scalable, and maintainable. It is especially useful for organizations that are transitioning to a cloud-first or DevOps culture.

## HOW
To implement the 12-factor app methodology, developers should:

- Use a version control system: Track all code changes in a centralized repository.
- Manage dependencies: Declare dependencies in a configuration file and isolate them from the application code.
- Store configuration externally: Keep configuration settings separate from the codebase.
- Treat backing services as attached resources: Treat external services like databases and message queues as resources that can be added or removed.
- Separate build, release, and run stages: Clearly define the build, release, and run phases of the application lifecycle.
- Run the application as processes: Execute the application as one or more processes that can be scaled horizontally.
- Bind the application to a port: Expose the application to the outside world through a well-defined port.
- Scale horizontally: Add more processes to handle increasing workloads.
- Design processes to be disposable: Make sure processes can be easily started, stopped, and restarted.
- Maintain parity between environments: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
- Treat logs as event streams: Stream logs to a centralized location for analysis and monitoring.
- Run admin tasks as one-off processes: Execute administrative tasks as separate processes that are not part of the main application.
- By following these principles, developers can create applications that are more portable, scalable, maintainable, and resilient.
